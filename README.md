# Autonomous Vehicle Simulation
Bachelor Thesis project


The topic of the thesis is the simulation of a self-driving vehicle in a virtual city in the Unity Framework. The vital components for the Unity Framework required to achieve a sufficient autonomous car are presented. The thesis gives an extensive overview of the currently used techniques in the modern-day automotive sector. It describes the implementation of one of these methods and takes the user through a detailed design process. After the design process, the thesis explains how to achieve a sufficient amount of control by trial and error techniques.  The implemented vehicle is tested in urban areas with pedestrians, traffic lights, and countryside highways with different cars.

In the end, a discussion and improvement of the approach have been noted. Assessment of the work has been made based on the observations during the research, development, and testing phases. The main goal of achieving an autonomous car component that can be deployed in several different virtual environments has been met.
